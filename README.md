The experience begins by placing the user in an orbit 382 km from the earth's surface, the player will be able to travel through the solar system thanks to the ship's propulsion system. After a while, and following the established trajectory, the user will find an Einstein-Rosen type wormhole that will allow him to travel through space time, this will take him to the farthest galaxy known to date, 13.2 billion light years, in just a few seconds, inside the wormhole, it will be possible to visualize the space time deformations.
In addition, there is a pleasant interface in which the player's ship and the planets of the solar system are shown to scale, with textures and information taken from the NASA database, thus emulating a journey through the universe captivating and educating the user.
